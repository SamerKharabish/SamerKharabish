# Salam & Hallo 👋
## I’m Samer from Germany.
- 👀 I’m mostly interested in embedded applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on smart-lights, an ESP-based LED strip controller for ambient lighting which works as standalone or integrated into a smart home.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything interesting. :)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m half german, half egyptian (even though i dont look like one :P).
